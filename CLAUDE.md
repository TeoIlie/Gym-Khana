## About F1TENTH

This is the F1TENTH Gym environment - a high-fidelity simulation platform for 1/10th scale autonomous racing cars. F1TENTH is an international autonomous racing competition and research platform that provides a standardized testbed for autonomous vehicle algorithms at reduced scale and cost.

### Autonomous Racing Context
The simulator models realistic vehicle dynamics, sensor data (LiDAR), and racing scenarios to enable development and testing of:
- **Path Planning**: Algorithms like Pure Pursuit (implemented in examples)
- **Control Systems**: Speed and steering control for high-speed racing
- **Perception**: LiDAR-based environment understanding
- **SLAM**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training autonomous racing agents

### Research Applications
- **Multi-agent Racing**: Support for multiple competing vehicles
- **Safety Systems**: Collision detection and avoidance
- **Vehicle Dynamics**: Realistic bicycle model with proper physics
- **Sensor Simulation**: Accurate LiDAR ray-casting for perception research
